# Projet_Cy

The C-Wire project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of energy data within a complex network structured around a hierarchy of power plants, substations, and distribution posts. The goal is to identify instances of overproduction and underproduction while calculating the distribution of energy consumption between businesses and individual consumers.

## Project Description
The C-Wire project aims to provide a synthesis of energy data from a complex network based on a hierarchical system of power plants, substations, and distribution stations. The goal is to identify situations of overproduction, underproduction, and to calculate the distribution of energy consumed by businesses and individuals.
Features
Script Shell Mode
	•	Data Filtering: Selection of relevant information from the input CSV file.
	•	Option Validation: Verification of passed arguments (stations, consumers, etc.).
	•	Output File Creation: Generation of CSV files containing the results of the analysis.

C Program Mode
	•	Data Processing: Calculation of energy consumption using an AVL to optimize performance.
	•	Generality: Management of HV-B, HV-A, and LV stations with a single program.
	•	Memory Management: Dynamic allocation and deallocation to minimize memory footprint.
	•	Data Validation: Checking input consistency and returning explicit errors in case of issues.
